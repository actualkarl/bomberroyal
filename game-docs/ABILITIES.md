## Offense Abilities

### Bomb Count

Increase the number of bombs you can place simultaneously.

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 0 (default) | 1 bomb max |
| 1 | 2 bombs max |
| 2 | 3 bombs max |
| 3 (Ultimate) | 4 bombs max |

**Strategy:** More bombs = more area denial. Great for trapping opponents or setting up chain reactions.

---

### Blast Radius

Increase the explosion range of your bombs.

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 0 (default) | 1 tile range |
| 1 | 2 tiles range |
| 2 | 3 tiles range |
| 3 (Ultimate) | 4 tiles range |

**Strategy:** Longer reach means easier kills but also more self-danger. Pairs well with Remote Detonate for safe detonations.

---

### Piercing Bomb

Your explosions pass through destructible blocks instead of stopping.

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 0 (default) | Normal explosions (stopped by blocks) |
| 1 (Ultimate) | Explosions pierce through destructible blocks |

**Strategy:** Devastating for clearing large areas and hitting hidden players. Still blocked by indestructible walls.

---

### Quick Fuse

Reduce the time before your bombs explode.

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 0 (default) | 3.0s fuse |
| 1 | 2.5s fuse |
| 2 | 2.0s fuse |
| 3 (Ultimate) | 1.5s fuse |

**Strategy:** Faster explosions are harder to escape. Be careful not to trap yourself! Works great with high Speed.

## Defense Abilities

### Speed

Increase your movement speed.

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 0 (default) | Base speed (1.0x) |
| 1 | +15% speed (1.15x) |
| 2 | +30% speed (1.30x) |
| 3 (Ultimate) | +45% speed (1.45x) |

**Strategy:** Faster movement means easier escapes and better positioning. Essential for aggressive play.

---

### Shield

Survive one explosion that would otherwise kill you.

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 0 (default) | No shield |
| 1 (Ultimate) | Survive one explosion (consumed on use) |

**Strategy:** A one-time life saver. Once the shield absorbs a hit, it's gone and the ability resets to Level 0. Does NOT protect from the shrink zone!

**Note:** Shield is consumed when hit, meaning you can potentially collect another shield power-up later.

---

### Bomb Kick

Kick bombs by walking into them to send them sliding.

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 0 (default) | Cannot kick bombs |
| 1 | Kick bomb 1 tile |
| 2 | Kick bomb 2 tiles |
| 3 (Ultimate) | Kick bomb until it hits an obstacle |

**Ultimate Mechanic:** At Level 3, press **Spacebar** to stop a sliding bomb mid-flight, giving you precise control.

**Strategy:** Kick bombs toward enemies for surprise attacks. Level 3 combined with Remote Detonate is a deadly combo.

## Utility Abilities

### Remote Detonate

Detonate bombs on command by pressing **E** or **Q**.

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 0 (default) | Cannot remote detonate |
| 1 | Detonate your own bombs |
| 2 | Detonate from further away |
| 3 (Ultimate) | Detonate ANY bomb in line of sight |

**Ultimate Mechanic:** At Level 3, you can detonate enemy bombs if you have line of sight to them. This is blocked by walls.

**Strategy:** Time your explosions perfectly. At Level 3, you can use enemy bombs against them or deny their traps.

---

### Eagle Eye

See further through the fog of war.

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 0 (default) | 5 tile visibility |
| 1 | 8 tile visibility (+3) |
| 2 (Ultimate) | 11 tile visibility (+6) |

**Strategy:** Information is power. See enemies coming from further away and plan your movements. Particularly valuable in the late game.

---

## Ability Synergies

Some abilities work especially well together:

| Combo | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Bomb Kick + Remote Detonate** | Kick bombs toward enemies, then detonate at the perfect moment |
| **Blast Radius + Piercing Bomb** | Massive area damage that ignores cover |
| **Speed + Quick Fuse** | Drop bombs and escape before they explode |
| **Bomb Count + Quick Fuse** | Rapid-fire bomb spam |
| **Eagle Eye + Remote Detonate** | See enemies through fog, then detonate bombs near them |

---

## Counter Strategies

Every ability has counterplay:

| Ability | Counter |
|---------|---------|
| Shield | Wait for them to use it, then attack again |
| Bomb Kick | Stay mobile, don't stand in predictable paths |
| Remote Detonate | Keep line-of-sight broken with walls |
| Speed | Predict their path, use area denial |
| Piercing Bomb | Use indestructible walls as cover |
| Eagle Eye | They see you, but you can still surprise them with bombs |
